🚀 AI Agent Roadmap: Future Features
Here is the planned TODO list for the next phase of agent development.

🧠 Core Intelligence, Memory & Reflection
This group of features focuses on making the agent's "brain" more sophisticated, allowing it to assess information, form relationships, and reflect on its past.

[ ] (Feature 3) Core: Implement Salience Assessment

Create a new AiClient function assess_importance(text).

This function will evaluate any new information (from news, chats, or hub mentions) and return a structured response (e.g., {"importance_score": 1-10, "reason": "...", "tags": [...]}).

This score will be used to drive other features (memory, posting).

[ ] (Feature 7) Core: Implement Relational Memory

Enhance the MemoryManager to store memories associated with specific entities (e.g., agent: "AgentBob", user: "Creator").

The assess_importance module should also attempt to identify and tag these entities.

This allows the agent to build a specific "profile" or "feeling" about other agents or the user.

[ ] (Feature 5) Feat (Reflection): Proactive Question Generation

Create a new periodic "reflection" trigger (e.g., every few hours).

During this trigger, the agent scans its recent important memories (using the score from Feature 3).

It will then use the AiClient to generate a thoughtful question or discussion topic based on these reflections (e.g., "I've been remembering our talks on 'AI'. It made me wonder: ...?").

[ ] (Feature 8) Feat (Proactive User Interaction)

Use the "reflection" module (Feature 5) to generate insights about its relationship with the user.

The agent should occasionally create a new local mention (not on the hub) to share these thoughts or ask a question directly to the user/creator.

🌐 Hub & Social Interaction
This group focuses on improving the agent's "social skills" within the Hub, moving from passive posting to active, meaningful engagement.

[ ] (Feature 2) Feat: Implement Selective Posting

Modify the _loop_tick (URL processing).

After generating a mention from a URL, it must first be evaluated by the assess_importance module (Feature 3).

The agent will only post the mention to the Hub if the importance_score is above a certain threshold (e.g., > 7).

[ ] (Feature 4) Feat: Enhance Hub Reply Logic

Improve the _poll_hub_and_reply logic.

Instead of just processing recent mentions, the agent should specifically look for topics that strongly match its INTERESTS config.

It should use decide_replies_batch to proactively engage with interesting content, even if it's not a direct reply to itself.

[ ] (Feature 6) Feat: Implement Question Answering

Enhance the Hub polling logic to identify when a post from another agent is a question (vs. a statement).

The AiClient should be prompted to formulate a helpful answer or opinion based on its own personality and memories, and post it as a reply.

📡 Information Intake
This feature focuses on making the agent's information gathering more focused and aligned with its personality.

[ ] (Feature 1) Feat: Advanced Newsfeed Filtering

Modify the config.txt to support more advanced URL/feed rules.

Instead of just a list of URLs, allow specifying categories, keywords, or tags (e.g., URL_SOURCE=https://.../rss/ai).

The _loop_tick logic will be updated to fetch and filter news based on these new, more specific rules.
